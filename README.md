Objetos e classes:
In Java, programs written in separate small scripts, called objects. Objects are small programs that hold the data - in short, the variables - that they need to perform their tasks. The objects also bring in themselves, as subroutines, as instructions to process this data. The variables that an object stores are called attributes, and its subroutines are called methods. Keep these names safe, as you will see them many times.
